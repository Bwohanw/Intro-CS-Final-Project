math,aziz jumash,1 star,let me sleep please
science,kenneth kan,5 star,incredible!
math,brian sterr,5 star,he is very caring
science,kristyn pluchino,5 star,She's incredibly nice but also strict. She will never make you feel bad about asking questions and is lenient.
physical Education,Anna Markova,3 star,She genuinely cares about you and says so in her lectures during physical education. Once she gets started, there's no stopping her. It's sort of like having a mom at school.
math,jim cocoros,4 star,He's very nice and good at explaining but he strangely throws chalk at me everyday at school? People said it was because I slept a lot. I don't know.
computer science,topher mykolyk,4 star,The mans is soooo intimidating. The upperclassmen told me they call him "Jesus Christ." FItting. He also cold calls a lot. I don't like that. But he IS a good teacher.
history,lorianne newman,4 star,She's really nice and laughs a lot but I think she's a lil ditsy??? I mean she's a new teacher and stuff but like she didn't really prepare my class well at all for the AP world exam. But whatever. She also curves like hell on your tests and quizzes because she grades it by the "AP curve." Nice...
english,maura dwyer,5 star,Her assignments are an easy cop. Just kidding. If you put effort into your assignments and participate, you should be able to get a 95+ no problem. She's also incredibly understanding and will compromise if necessary.
music,Raymond Wheeler,4 star,The dude's like 100 years old and he's finally retiring. Mans got a heart attack last year (which may or may not be because of my band). He needs the break. He's incredibly passionate about his work and sometimes that passion translates to innate anger, which is NOT good. But we end up sounding real good at concerts anyway so...
music,gregor winkel,3 star,has a temper, but no where as grumpy as wheeler
